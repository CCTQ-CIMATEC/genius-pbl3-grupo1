1 - FETCH   - FIXED WRONG ADDR_WIDTH ISSUE IT WAS RECEIVING 10 BUT THERE WAS AN Z VALUE AT 10;
2 - DECODER - FIXED WRONG SIZE OF VARIABLES, PC WAS WITH 32 AND OTHERS WITH 33
3 - EXECUTE - FLUSH AT EXECUTE STATE IS AT Z VALUE, THERE WAS NO CLK, RST AND FLUSH IN THE INSTANCE OF EXECUTE IN PIPELINE
4 - DECODER - INSIDE THE CONTROLLER WE STILL WERE USING THE L_BRANCH INSTEAD OF THE NEW OUTPUT O_BRANCH, SO THE VALUE WAS DRIVEN TO X
5 - EXECUTE - WAS PASSING DATA INSTEAD OF ADDR TO THE HAZARD STAGE FOR FORWARDING DATA
6 - DECODER - WRONG IMMEDIATE RESULT, WHY? REASON, MEMORY HAD 30 WIDTH FOR DUMB REASON OF DOUBLE -1;
